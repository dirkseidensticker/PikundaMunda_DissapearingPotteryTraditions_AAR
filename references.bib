  abstract = {Fine-grained ``chalky'' pottery containing microscopic sponge spicules is commonly recovered from archaeological sites throughout peninsular Florida, but many questions remain about its composition and origins. It is identified by different names, but most are associated with the St. Johns Type series. While it has been commonly assumed to originate in the St. Johns River drainage for which it is named, the prevalence of pottery with these characteristics in other locations has presented the likelihood of independent production in multiple places. In this study, we conducted LA-ICP-MS and XRD analysis of spiculate pottery from three Woodland period (ca. 1000 BCE to 1000 CE) sites, along with comparative clay samples, in order to characterize the raw materials and determine the geographic scope of production. Our results support the theory that this ware was independently produced across peninsular Florida. We further evaluate the hypothesis that this pottery was made with common wetland muck, through consideration of the material properties of muck constituents. This project emphasizes the importance of an ecosystem framework for understanding the long history of spiculate pottery production and its geographic spread within Florida.},

What roles have agriculture, geography, climate, ethnic identity, and language ideologies played in language spread? In this volume, international experts in the field provide new answers to these and related questions, drawing on the increasingly large databases available and on novel analytical research techniques.0The first part of the volume outlines some general issues and approaches in the study of language dispersal, diversification, and contact. In the rest of the volume, chapters compare the language and population histories of three major regions - Island Southeast Asia/Oceania, Africa, and South America - which show particularly interesting contrasts in the distribution of languages and language families. The volume is interdisciplinary in approach, with insights from archaeology, genetics, anthropology, and geography, and will be of interest to a wide range of scholars interested in language diversity and contact.},

D. 800) and Savannah (A.D. 800-1500) period pottery from the St. Marys region were investigated through microscopic examination of aplastic constituents together with consideration ofrefired paste color and sherd thickness. Three gross paste categories were recognized: non-spiculateI non-micaceous paste, representing at least two to five possible clay sources; sponge-spiculate paste representing at least four to five clay sources; and micaceous paste, representing at least four clay sources. It is necessary to use a microscope with at least 105 x in order to recognize most of the paste categories. The results show that Deptford and Savannah period pottery can be distinguished in terms of paste as well as surface treatment. The Deptford period samples are characterized by the predominance of nonspiculateI non-micaceous grit and sand paste. The Savannah period samples are characterized by the abundance of spongespiculate and micaceous pastes. Plain and cord-marked Savannah period pottery is further distinguished by the prominence of grog tempering and absence of grit tempering in the plain wares. The results indicate that these data may be useful for predicting the temporal affiliation of St. Marys region pottery assemblages that lack a clear-cut distinction in surface treatment or in the absence of diagnostic decorated types or other datable remains. The paste data are also well suited for studying the pottery in terms of patterns of clay resource use and manufacturing origins.]},

In order to improve the archaeological study in the region we carried out a detailed mineralogical and chemical study of the fragments of ceramic artifacts found in the two ABE sites of CachoeiraPorteira, in the Lower Amazon Region. Their ceramics comprise the following tempers: cauixi, cariap\'e, sand, sand +feldspars, crushed ceramic and so on and are composed of quartz, clay equivalent material (mainly burned kaolinite), feldspars, hematite, goethite, maghemite, phosphates, anatase, and minerals of Mn and Ba. Cauixi and cariap\'e, siliceous organic compounds, were found too. The mineralogical composition and the morphology of their grains indicate a saprolite (clayey material rich on quartz) derived from fine-grained felsic igneous rocks or sedimentary rocks as source material for ceramic artifacts, where silica-rich components such cauixi, cariap\'e and/or sand (feldspar and rock fragments) were intentionally added to them. The high content of (Al,Fe)-phosphates, amorphous to low crystalline, must be product of the contact between the clayey matrix of pottery wall and the hot aqueous solution formed during the daily cooking of animal foods (main source of phosphor). The phosphate crystallization took place during the discharge of the potteries put together with waste of organic material from animal and vegetal origin, and leaving to the formation of the ABE-soil profile.},

  abstract = {Large sets of radiocarbon dates are increasingly used as proxies for inferring past population dynamics and the last few years, in particular, saw an increase in the development of new statistical techniques to overcome some of the key challenges imposed by this kind of data. These include: 1) null hypothesis significance testing approaches based on Monte-Carlo simulations or mark permutations; 2) non-parametric Bayesian modelling approaches, and 3) the use of more traditional techniques such as correlation, regression, and AIC-based model comparison directly on the summed probability distribution of radiocarbon dates (SPD). While the range of opportunities offered by these solutions is unquestionably appealing, they often do not consider the uncertainty and the biases arising from calibration effects or sampling error. Here we introduce a novel Bayesian approach and               nimbleCarbon               , an R package that offers model fitting and comparison for population growth models based on the temporal frequency data of radiocarbon dates. We evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach on a range of simulated scenarios and illustrate its application on a case study focused on the demographic impact of the introduction of wet-rice farming in prehistoric Japan during the 1st millennium BCE.},

  abstract = {Technical processes\textemdash or cha\^ines op\'eratoires\textemdash are heterogeneous cultural aggregates articulating raw materials, tools, knowledge, representations, and agents. The nature and arrangement of these elements stem from a web of social, historical, and ecological relations that not only delineate a sociohistorical framework within which artisans operate, but also determine how individuals shape and give meaning to their daily engagement in the craft. Pottery cha\^ines op\'eratoires have been the focus of a large body of ethnographical studies in Africa since the beginning of the 20th century, most of them developing within the subfield of ethnoarchaeology. Yet pottery cha\^ines op\'eratoires may also provide crucial information to historians when analyzed through an approach inspired from historical linguistics and tentatively called ``comparative technology.'' Pioneered by Haudricourt, this approach combines two levels of comparison. The first consists in a minute comparison of different cha\^ines op\'eratoires within a given field of activity and geographical area in order to identify similarities and differences in tools, materials, gestures, and the organization of operations. This allows for the identification of specific ``technical traditions''; that is, shared ways of doing that stem from a shared set of knowledge. The second level of comparison implies a mapping of the technical traditions (be it whole cha\^ines op\'eratoires or particular stages or components), with the aim of identifying and characterizing their respective spatial distributions: for example, the effects of aggregation or disintegration, possible boundaries, or interpenetrations.             The relevance of spatial distributions in history-oriented analyses of technical processes is twofold. First, spatial distributions compel us to explore the sociohistorical processes from which they resulted; that is, the set of relations\textemdash social, economic, political, and ecological\textemdash that determine how artisans interact with each other, share knowledge, use tools and materials, cope with changing situations, or seize new opportunities. Second, spatial distributions may reveal strong and time-enduring connections with various kinds of social identities (e.g., languages, political factionalism, regional affiliation, gender, and ethnicity). When the underlying mechanisms of such connections are appropriately understood, they may be used to formulate hypotheses about past processes, including population movements, the development and evolution of political boundaries, identity negotiations, or socio-economical transformations. Here, cha\^ines op\'eratoires may prove especially reliable for historians since they are less easily and deliberately manipulated than written or oral documents},

The Bantu expansion that swept out of West Central Africa beginning {$\sim$}5,000 y ago is one of the most influential cultural events of its kind, eventually spreading over a vast geographical area a new way of life in which farming played an increasingly important role. We use a new dated phylogeny of {$\sim$}400 Bantu languages to show that migrating Bantu-speaking populations did not expand from their ancestral homeland in a random walk but, rather, followed emerging savannah corridors, with rainforest habitats repeatedly imposing temporal barriers to movement. When populations did move from savannah into rainforest, rates of migration were slowed, delaying the occupation of the rainforest by on average 300 y, compared with similar migratory movements exclusively within savannah or within rainforest by established rainforest populations. Despite unmatched abilities to produce innovations culturally, unfamiliar habitats significantly alter the route and pace of human dispersals.},

  abstract = {The Bantu expansion transformed the linguistic, economic, and cultural composition of sub-Saharan Africa. However, the exact dates and routes taken by the ancestors of the speakers of the more than 500 current Bantu languages remain uncertain. Here, we use the recently developed ``break-away'' geographical diffusion model, specially designed for modeling migrations, with ``augmented'' geographic information, to reconstruct the Bantu language family expansion. This Bayesian phylogeographic approach with augmented geographical data provides a powerful way of linking linguistic, archaeological, and genetic data to test hypotheses about large language family expansions. We compare four hypotheses: an early major split north of the rainforest; a migration through the Sangha River Interval corridor around 2,500 BP; a coastal migration around 4,000 BP; and a migration through the rainforest before the corridor opening, at 4,000 BP. Our results produce a topology and timeline for the Bantu language family, which supports the hypothesis of an expansion through Central African tropical forests at 4,420 BP (4,040 to 5,000 95\% highest posterior density interval), well before the Sangha River Interval was open.},

This is a pragmatic approach that appreciates scientific measurements of metal objects as essential empirical evidence whilst recognising that a considerable share of these archaeometric data are inapt or too detailed for an understanding of skill. This empirical approach towards skill is relevant to our knowledge of the role of crafts and materials in the past. After all, skill is a fundamental asset for the production of material culture, and a distinct human-material relationship characterised by an intimate form of material engagement.},

This sequence consists in a succession of archaeological cultures displaying elements of rupture and continuity, particularly visible in the shape and decoration of pottery. To answer questions pertaining to population dynamics in central Katanga, we decided to check whether or not these variations where reflected in pottery roughing-out technologies. Because they are related to a strong interaction between master and apprentice and are associated to an essential step of pottery apprenticeship, pottery roughing-out methods are indeed considered to be more stable -- i.e. related to deeply rooted forms of identity - than form or decoration. In this paper, we present the analysis and reconstruction of Kabambian pottery roughing-out methods - a first for central Africa. Our conclusion indicates, that Kabambian pottery (dated between the 13th and the 18th century AD) was made by cylindrical coiling with slab bottom.},

  abstract = {During the warmer Holocene Period, two major climatic crises affected the Central African rainforests. The first crisis, around 4000 cal yr BP, caused the contraction of the forest in favor of savanna expansion at its northern and southern periphery. The second crisis, around 2500 cal yr BP, resulted in major perturbation at the forest core, leading to forest disturbance and fragmentation with a rapid expansion of pioneer-type vegetation, and a marked erosional phase. The major driver of these two climatic crises appears to be rapid sea-surface temperature variations in the equatorial eastern Atlantic, which modified the regional atmospheric circulation. The change between ca. 2500 to 2000 cal yr BP led to a large increase in thunderstorm activity, which explains the phase of forest fragmentation. Ultimately, climatic data obtained recently show that the present-day major rise in thunderstorms and lightning activity in Central Africa could result from some kind of solar influence, and hence the phase of forest fragmentation between ca. 2500 to 2000 cal yr BP may provide a model for the present-day global warming-related environmental changes in this region.},

  abstract = {Human settlement of the Caribbean represents the only example in the Americas of peoples colonizing islands that were not visible from surrounding mainland areas or other islands. Unfortunately, many interpretive models have relied on radiocarbon determinations that do not meet standard criteria for reporting because they lack critical information or sufficient provenience, often leading to specious interpretations. We have collated 2484 radiocarbon determinations, assigned them to classes based on chronometric hygiene criteria, and constructed Bayesian colonization models of the acceptable determinations to examine patterns of initial settlement. Colonization estimates for 26 islands indicate that (i) the region was settled in two major population dispersals that likely originated from South America; (ii) colonists reached islands in the northern Antilles before the southern islands; and (iii) the results support the southward route hypothesis and refute the ``stepping-stone model.''},

This review provides a spatiotemporal framework of human settlement in the forest biome. Beyond the well-known initial spread of Iron Age populations through central African forests from 2500 cal BP, it depicts the geographical patterns and links with the cultural evolution of the successive phases of human expansion from 5000 to 3000 cal BP and then from 3000 to 1600 cal BP, of the hinterland depopulation from 1350 to 860 cal BP, and of recolonization up to 500 cal BP.

Within this framework, a first approach to the chronological variability of pottery through the analysis of 58 ceramic thin sections is carried out. The samples correspond to vessels made by complex hunter-gatherer groups between 625 {$\pm$} 46 and 1.380 {$\pm$} 100 14C years BP. The pottery was recovered from three archaeological sites: Arroyo Arenal 1, Arroyo Largo I, and La Palmera II (Entre Rios Province, northeastern Argentina), which are linked to an archaeological unit locally called Goya-Malabrigo. The results show, among other chronological variations, an increasing trend in the use of grog temper over time. These data allow the expansion of knowledge about the ceramic technology of human groups who occupied the area of the Paran\'a River during the Late Holocene.},

In this paper, we provide a critical review of the extant linguistic and molecular anthropological data on Africa and discuss the insights they provide concerning the expansion itself as well as the demographic processes involved in it. Contrary to some assumptions by historians and cultural anthropologists, the genetic data speak in favor of an actual movement of peoples during the expansion of the Bantu languages over Africa, rather than a spread through language and culture shift. Furthermore, the molecular data indicate that sociocultural practices such as patrilocalityand possiblyeven polygynyplayed a role in shaping the genetic diversity of Bantu-speaking peoples. These sociocultural practices might explain why, in Africa, there is a correlation between Y-chromosomal (i.e., paternal) lineages and linguistic affiliation, but not betweenmtDNA (maternal) lineages and language.},

This zooarchaeological study addresses whether the presence of spicules of freshwater sponges in this pottery was a conscious choice on behalf of ancient potters. Based on faunal elements detected in the collection of the Vereda III site and information obtained from ethnographic records and archaeological research on the presence of cauixi in pottery, we discuss whetherits presence in the material results from the inclusion of processed freshwater sponges in the clay or if it derives from the exploitation of sedimentary deposits with spicules. As one of the outcomes, this articlepoints to a necessary revision of the archaeological pottery material of the Aratu-Sapuca\'i tradition in Minas Gerais where the identification of cauixi and its origin should both be considered.},

While for the past decades' pottery finds were used to establish sequences of stylistically interrelated pottery groups and to derive regional chrono-historical frameworks, the way these communities of practice transmitted their approaches and expertise throughout generations is still unknown. The first study focusing on petrographic characterizations of ceramics from the north-western parts of the Congo Basin showed distinct phases of similar clay procurement and processing. Of special interest is the site of Pikunda (PIK). In the late 1980s, multiple archaeological features were excavated and ethnographic observations on potters' production showed a particular {$<$}em{$>$}cha\^ine op\'eratoire{$<$}/em{$>$}, comprised of coiling, internal scraping, and external beating.

  abstract = {This paper contains the results of petrographic analysis on 22 ceramic fragments from the Bacabal phase of the Monte Castelo shell mound (Rond\^onia), one of the oldest Amazonian potteries dating up to 4,000 years BP. The petrographic analysis confirmed the high frequency of freshwater sponge spicules (cauixi) as a non-plastic, with novel data on the distribution of spicules that allow us to infer the process of ceramic paste preparation and vessel manufacture. The same proportion between clay matrix and sponge spicules was maintained throughout all Bacabal layers, independent of individual variations for each element. This allows us to infer the existence of a pottery recipe maintained throughout the Bacabal occupation of the site. The same type of sponge spicule described in the ceramic paste was identified in clayey sediments surveyed in the region, although at a lower frequency. Thus, the manufacture of Bacabal ceramics could have involved a combination of: selection of spicule-rich clays; and intentionally added sponge spicules. Sponge spicules in the Bacabal pottery represent an exceptional case for research into the development of ceramic technologies supported by the use of these non-plastics, which became popular during the Upper Holocene in the lowlands of South America.},
