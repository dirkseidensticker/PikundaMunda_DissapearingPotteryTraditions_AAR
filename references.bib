  abstract = {The increasingly better-known archaeological record of the Amazon basin, the Orinoco basin and the Guianas both questions the long-standing premise of a pristine tropical rainforest environment and also provides evidence for major biome-scale cultural and technological transitions prior to European colonization. Associated changes in pre-Columbian human population size and density, however, are poorly known and often estimated on the basis of unreliable assumptions and guesswork. Drawing on recent developments in the aggregate analysis of large radiocarbon databases, here we present and examine different proxies for relative population change between 1050 BC and AD 1500 within this broad region. By using a robust model testing approach, our analyses document that the growth of pre-Columbian human population over the 1700 years prior to European colonization adheres to a logistic model of demographic growth. This suggests that, at an aggregate level, these pre-Columbian populations had potentially reached carrying capacity (however high) before the onset of European colonization. Our analyses also demonstrate that this aggregate scenario shows considerable variability when projected geographically, highlighting significant gaps in archaeological knowledge yet also providing important insights into the resilience of past human food procurement strategies. By offering a new understanding of biome-wide pre-Columbian demographic trends based on empirical evidence, our analysis hopes to unfetter novel perspectives on demic expansions, language diversification trajectories and subsistence intensification processes in the Amazonian biome during the late Holocene.

There is striking consistency in the inferred human population dynamics across different regions of Britain and Ireland during the middle and later Holocene. Major cross-regional population downturns in population coincide with episodes of more abrupt change in North Atlantic climate and witness societal responses in food procurement as visible in directly dated plants and animals, often with moves toward hardier cereals, increased pastoralism, and/or gathered resources. For the Neolithic, this evidence questions existing models of wholly endogenous demographic boom-bust. For the wider Holocene, it demonstrates that climate-related disruptions have been quasi-periodic drivers of societal and subsistence change.},

  abstract = {Fine-grained ``chalky'' pottery containing microscopic sponge spicules is commonly recovered from archaeological sites throughout peninsular Florida, but many questions remain about its composition and origins. It is identified by different names, but most are associated with the St. Johns Type series. While it has been commonly assumed to originate in the St. Johns River drainage for which it is named, the prevalence of pottery with these characteristics in other locations has presented the likelihood of independent production in multiple places. In this study, we conducted LA-ICP-MS and XRD analysis of spiculate pottery from three Woodland period (ca. 1000 BCE to 1000 CE) sites, along with comparative clay samples, in order to characterize the raw materials and determine the geographic scope of production. Our results support the theory that this ware was independently produced across peninsular Florida. We further evaluate the hypothesis that this pottery was made with common wetland muck, through consideration of the material properties of muck constituents. This project emphasizes the importance of an ecosystem framework for understanding the long history of spiculate pottery production and its geographic spread within Florida.},

What roles have agriculture, geography, climate, ethnic identity, and language ideologies played in language spread? In this volume, international experts in the field provide new answers to these and related questions, drawing on the increasingly large databases available and on novel analytical research techniques.0The first part of the volume outlines some general issues and approaches in the study of language dispersal, diversification, and contact. In the rest of the volume, chapters compare the language and population histories of three major regions - Island Southeast Asia/Oceania, Africa, and South America - which show particularly interesting contrasts in the distribution of languages and language families. The volume is interdisciplinary in approach, with insights from archaeology, genetics, anthropology, and geography, and will be of interest to a wide range of scholars interested in language diversity and contact.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first review of biases impacting Pleistocene and Holocene radiocarbon dates from Central Africa. Based on the pooling of the research expertise of the co-authors, twenty-four biases are listed, explained and documented and their impact on any radiocarbon date corpus demonstrated. To achieve this, a new corpus has been created of 1764 radiocarbon and TL assays from 601 archaeological sites published in the literature. Each date has been checked for its context. The irregular dynamics of research in space and time seriously impact the end result of previous analyses aiming to achieve a regional understanding of past demographic fluctuations. While peaks in the number of dates from the late Holocene seem to correspond to a positive demographic trend, it is suggested that the declines identified cannot be of any such use for the time being and that today's picture does not presently support claims of a population ``crash'' at a regional or local level for any time period. The numbers are obscured by overall research deficits identifiable throughout the region. The maps of the dated sites presented offer good evidence of this and illustrate the vast expanses where no archaeological research has yet been carried out. The number of radiocarbon dates in Central Africa is more an indicator of the effort archaeologists have put into understanding a settlement than it is of ancient demographics. Successive waves of incoming people since c. 3500--3000 cal. BP, the two most important ones known since the 1990s, have created a cultural mosaic of coexisting technological groups. The last 40 years of research have revealed the inner complexity of these waves, some of which avoided parts of the region for centuries, thereby creating an irregular cultural mosaic of land use that is outlined by patterning in the radiocarbon dates.},

D. 800) and Savannah (A.D. 800-1500) period pottery from the St. Marys region were investigated through microscopic examination of aplastic constituents together with consideration ofrefired paste color and sherd thickness. Three gross paste categories were recognized: non-spiculateI non-micaceous paste, representing at least two to five possible clay sources; sponge-spiculate paste representing at least four to five clay sources; and micaceous paste, representing at least four clay sources. It is necessary to use a microscope with at least 105 x in order to recognize most of the paste categories. The results show that Deptford and Savannah period pottery can be distinguished in terms of paste as well as surface treatment. The Deptford period samples are characterized by the predominance of nonspiculateI non-micaceous grit and sand paste. The Savannah period samples are characterized by the abundance of spongespiculate and micaceous pastes. Plain and cord-marked Savannah period pottery is further distinguished by the prominence of grog tempering and absence of grit tempering in the plain wares. The results indicate that these data may be useful for predicting the temporal affiliation of St. Marys region pottery assemblages that lack a clear-cut distinction in surface treatment or in the absence of diagnostic decorated types or other datable remains. The paste data are also well suited for studying the pottery in terms of patterns of clay resource use and manufacturing origins.]},

  abstract = {Several archaeological black earth (ABE) sites occur in the Amazon region. They contain fragments of ceramic artifacts, which are very important for the archaeological purpose. In order to improve the archaeological study in the region we carried out a detailed mineralogical and chemical study of the fragments of ceramic artifacts found in the two ABE sites of CachoeiraPorteira, in the Lower Amazon Region. Their ceramics comprise the following tempers: cauixi, cariap{\'e}, sand, sand +feldspars, crushed ceramic and so on and are composed of quartz, clay equivalent material (mainly burned kaolinite), feldspars, hematite, goethite, maghemite, phosphates, anatase, and minerals of Mn and Ba. Cauixi and cariap{\'e}, siliceous organic compounds, were found too. The mineralogical composition and the morphology of their grains indicate a saprolite (clayey material rich on quartz) derived from fine-grained felsic igneous rocks or sedimentary rocks as source material for ceramic artifacts, where silica-rich components such cauixi, cariap{\'e} and/or sand (feldspar and rock fragments) were intentionally added to them. The high content of (Al,Fe)-phosphates, amorphous to low crystalline, must be product of the contact between the clayey matrix of pottery wall and the hot aqueous solution formed during the daily cooking of animal foods (main source of phosphor). The phosphate crystallization took place during the discharge of the potteries put together with waste of organic material from animal and vegetal origin, and leaving to the formation of the ABE-soil profile.},

  abstract = {Large sets of radiocarbon dates are increasingly used as proxies for inferring past population dynamics and the last few years, in particular, saw an increase in the development of new statistical techniques to overcome some of the key challenges imposed by this kind of data. These include: 1) null hypothesis significance testing approaches based on Monte-Carlo simulations or mark permutations; 2) non-parametric Bayesian modelling approaches, and 3) the use of more traditional techniques such as correlation, regression, and AIC-based model comparison directly on the summed probability distribution of radiocarbon dates (SPD). While the range of opportunities offered by these solutions is unquestionably appealing, they often do not consider the uncertainty and the biases arising from calibration effects or sampling error. Here we introduce a novel Bayesian approach and               nimbleCarbon               , an R package that offers model fitting and comparison for population growth models based on the temporal frequency data of radiocarbon dates. We evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach on a range of simulated scenarios and illustrate its application on a case study focused on the demographic impact of the introduction of wet-rice farming in prehistoric Japan during the 1st millennium BCE.},

Pour la premi{\`e}re fois dans cette r{\'e}gion, cette p{\'e}riodisation est bas{\'e}e sur des contextes stratigraphiques soigneusement renseign{\'e}s, obtenus sur la n{\'e}cropole de Wanar (S{\'e}n{\'e}gal). Le croisement des approches typologiques et technologiques r{\'e}v{\`e}le diff{\'e}rentes productions, reflets de traditions c{\'e}ramiques et de groupes artisanaux distincts. {\`A} Wanar, la succession de ces productions aux caract{\`e}res morpho-fonctionnels sp{\'e}cifiques a pu {\^e}tre corr{\'e}l{\'e}e avec l'{\'e}mergence de styles architecturaux particuliers. Cette p{\'e}riodisation offre {\'e}galement une lecture renouvel{\'e}e des corpus c{\'e}ramiques issus de fouilles anciennes. Elle interroge par ailleurs le statut des productions c{\'e}ramiques et des sites, en distinguant les vestiges ant{\'e}rieurs {\`a} l'{\'e}rection des architectures monumentales de ceux participant pleinement {\`a} leur fonctionnement rituel. Cette recherche permet finalement d'entamer une r{\'e}flexion sur la place des traditions c{\'e}ramiques s{\'e}n{\'e}gambiennes au sein de l'Afrique de l'Ouest m{\'e}di{\'e}vale.                            This article aims to detail the construction and results of a new periodization of ceramic productions from megalithic sites in Senegal and The Gambia (8th-16th centuries               CE               ). For the first time there, this model is based on carefully documented stratigraphic contexts obtained on the necropolis of Wanar (Senegal). The intersection of typological and technological approaches reveals different productions, reflections of ceramic traditions, and distinct craft groups. In Wanar, the succession of these productions with specific morpho-functional characters could be correlated with the emergence of particular architectural styles. This periodization also integrates materials from previous excavations and thus offers a renewed reading of it. The distinction between ceramic vestiges anterior to the erection of monumental architectures and others fully participating in their ritual functioning leads to question both the status of ceramic productions and sites. This research finally contributes to integrating Senegambian pottery production into the broader context of medieval West Africa.},

  abstract = {Understanding past population dynamics in lowland South America relative to changes in subsistence is crucial for drawing comparisons with global processes. Here, we use aggregated radiocarbon data as a palae\- odemography proxy for in the eastern La Plata Basin and adjacent Atlantic coast, southeastern South America. Our results show that population dynamics in the study area are best explained by a three-phase model consisting of exponential growth {\textasciitilde}6000-4000 cal BP, linear decrease {\textasciitilde}4000-2000 cal BP and further exponential growth {\textasciitilde}2000-500 cal BP. Local deviations from the regional trend show a heterogeneous landscape, with the first phase of exponential growth mainly driven by activity in the coast. Although the first adoption of domesticated plants occurs during that period, a causal relationship with population growth cannot be established, as plant culti\- vation may have been incorporated into the economy of already large and settled populations approaching carrying capacity. The second phase of exponential growth follows the arrival of new cultural traditions, bringing with them a more diverse package of cultivated plants and landscape management practises. Our results high\- light the complexity of the relationships between population dynamics and changes in economy in South America, with a delayed transition attested in our study region.},

With a comprehensive genomic dataset, including newly generated data of modern-day and ancient DNA from previously unsampled regions in Africa, we contribute insights into this expansion that started 6,000--4,000\,years ago in western Africa. We genotyped 1,763 participants, including 1,526 Bantu speakers from 147 populations across 14 African countries, and generated whole-genome sequences from 12 Late Iron Age individuals               8               . We show that genetic diversity amongst Bantu-speaking populations declines with distance from western Africa, with current-day Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo as possible crossroads of interaction. Using spatially explicit methods               9               and correlating genetic, linguistic and geographical data, we provide cross-disciplinary support for a serial-founder migration model. We further show that Bantu speakers received significant gene flow from local groups in regions they expanded into. Our genetic dataset provides an exhaustive modern-day African comparative dataset for ancient DNA studies               10               and will be important to a wide range of disciplines from science and humanities, as well as to the medical sector studying human genetic variation and health in African and African-descendant populations.},

  abstract = {Technical processes---or cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires---are heterogeneous cultural aggregates articulating raw materials, tools, knowledge, representations, and agents. The nature and arrangement of these elements stem from a web of social, historical, and ecological relations that not only delineate a sociohistorical framework within which artisans operate, but also determine how individuals shape and give meaning to their daily engagement in the craft. Pottery cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires have been the focus of a large body of ethnographical studies in Africa since the beginning of the 20th century, most of them developing within the subfield of ethnoarchaeology. Yet pottery cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires may also provide crucial information to historians when analyzed through an approach inspired from historical linguistics and tentatively called ``comparative technology.'' Pioneered by Haudricourt, this approach combines two levels of comparison. The first consists in a minute comparison of different cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires within a given field of activity and geographical area in order to identify similarities and differences in tools, materials, gestures, and the organization of operations. This allows for the identification of specific ``technical traditions''; that is, shared ways of doing that stem from a shared set of knowledge. The second level of comparison implies a mapping of the technical traditions (be it whole cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires or particular stages or components), with the aim of identifying and characterizing their respective spatial distributions: for example, the effects of aggregation or disintegration, possible boundaries, or interpenetrations.             The relevance of spatial distributions in history-oriented analyses of technical processes is twofold. First, spatial distributions compel us to explore the sociohistorical processes from which they resulted; that is, the set of relations---social, economic, political, and ecological---that determine how artisans interact with each other, share knowledge, use tools and materials, cope with changing situations, or seize new opportunities. Second, spatial distributions may reveal strong and time-enduring connections with various kinds of social identities (e.g., languages, political factionalism, regional affiliation, gender, and ethnicity). When the underlying mechanisms of such connections are appropriately understood, they may be used to formulate hypotheses about past processes, including population movements, the development and evolution of political boundaries, identity negotiations, or socio-economical transformations. Here, cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires may prove especially reliable for historians since they are less easily and deliberately manipulated than written or oral documents},

Yet, despite its relevance for human origins and spread around the globe, the formation and processes of its gene pool in the past are still largely unknown. Here, we present a time transect of genome-wide sequences from nine individuals recovered from a single site in South Africa, Oakhurst Rockshelter. Spanning the whole Holocene, the ancient DNA of these individuals allows us to reconstruct the demographic trajectories of the indigenous San population and their ancestors during the last 10,000\,years. We show that, in contrast to most regions around the world, the population history of southernmost Africa was not characterized by several waves of migration, replacement and admixture but by long-lasting genetic continuity from the early Holocene to the end of the Later Stone Age. Although the advent of pastoralism and farming substantially transformed the gene pool in most parts of southern Africa after 1,300\,               bp               , we demonstrate using allele-frequency and identity-by-descent segment-based methods that the {\ddag}Khomani San and Karretjiemense from South Africa still show direct signs of relatedness to the Oakhurst hunter-gatherers, a pattern obscured by recent, extensive non-Southern African admixture. Yet, some southern San in South Africa still preserve this ancient, Pleistocene-derived genetic signature, extending the period of genetic continuity until today.},

The Bantu expansion that swept out of West Central Africa beginning {$\sim$}5,000 y ago is one of the most influential cultural events of its kind, eventually spreading over a vast geographical area a new way of life in which farming played an increasingly important role. We use a new dated phylogeny of {$\sim$}400 Bantu languages to show that migrating Bantu-speaking populations did not expand from their ancestral homeland in a random walk but, rather, followed emerging savannah corridors, with rainforest habitats repeatedly imposing temporal barriers to movement. When populations did move from savannah into rainforest, rates of migration were slowed, delaying the occupation of the rainforest by on average 300 y, compared with similar migratory movements exclusively within savannah or within rainforest by established rainforest populations. Despite unmatched abilities to produce innovations culturally, unfamiliar habitats significantly alter the route and pace of human dispersals.},

It shows a peeling movement from Cameroon's grassfields, into southern Cameroon, then along a savanna corridor through West Central Africa's rainforests, into the Savannahs, then to Southern Africa, the Great Lakes, and Indian Ocean coast. The clear sequence of movement masks methodological and historical factors. Language death, multilingualism, and the limits of vocabulary evidence restrain the classification's authority. `Transformations' from food collecting to food producing or from no metals to full engagement with metals were mutable, unfolded at different speeds, and involved interactions with firstcomers. In Central Africa, Bantu speakers were often the first farmers and metal-users in the region but elsewhere they were commonly neither. Their arrivals did not immediately displace firstcomers. Computational methods can accommodate many of these issues.},

  abstract = {Traditional archaeological ideas about Neolithic societies were shaped by questionable premises. The modern concept of social and cultural coherence of residence groups as well as the ethnic interpretation of `archaeological cultures' fostered ideas of static and homogeneous social entities with fixed borders. Farming -- as the core of the Neolithic way of life -- was associated with sedentariness rather than with spatial mobility and cross-regional social networks. Furthermore, the widely used (neo-)evolutionist thinking universally assumed a growing social complexity and hierarchisation during prehistory. After all, such `top-down'--perspectives deprived individuals and groups of genuine agency and creativity while underestimating the relational dynamic between the social and material worlds. In recent years, a wide array of empirical results on social practices related to material culture and settlement dynamics, (inter-)regional entanglements and spatial mobility were published. For the latter the adoption of the relatively new scientific methods in archaeology like Stable Isotope Analysis as well as aDNA played a crucial role. Yet the question of possible inferences regarding spatial and temporal differences in forms of social organisation has not been addressed sufficiently.   The aim of this volume is therefore to rethink former top-down concepts of Neolithic societies by studying social practices and different forms of Neolithic social life by adopting bottom-up social archaeological perspectives. Furthermore, the validity and relevance of terms like `society', `community', `social group' etc. will be discussed. The contributions reach from theoretical to empirical ones and thematize a variety of social theoretical approaches as well as methodological ways of combining different sorts of data. They show the potential of such bottom-up approaches to infer models of social practices and configurations which may live up to the potential social diversity and dynamism of Neolithic societies. The contribution shed light on spatial mobility, social complexity, the importance of (political) interests and factors of kinship etc. We hope that this volume, with its focus on the Neolithic of Europe, will contribute to the ongoing critical debates of theories and concepts as well as on our premises and perspectives on Neolithic societies in general -- and the practices of social archaeology as such.},

However, the exact dates and routes taken by the ancestors of the speakers of the more than 500 current Bantu languages remain uncertain. Here, we use the recently developed ``break-away'' geographical diffusion model, specially designed for modeling migrations, with ``augmented'' geographic information, to reconstruct the Bantu language family expansion. This Bayesian phylogeographic approach with augmented geographical data provides a powerful way of linking linguistic, archaeological, and genetic data to test hypotheses about large language family expansions. We compare four hypotheses: an early major split north of the rainforest; a migration through the Sangha River Interval corridor around 2,500 BP; a coastal migration around 4,000 BP; and a migration through the rainforest before the corridor opening, at 4,000 BP. Our results produce a topology and timeline for the Bantu language family, which supports the hypothesis of an expansion through Central African tropical forests at 4,420 BP (4,040 to 5,000 95\% highest posterior density interval), well before the Sangha River Interval was open.},

Based on scientific data provided by the material sciences, in this case compositional and metallographic analyses of Late Copper Age and Early Bronze Age axes, the thresholds to categorise and interpret these data, and organise them in a cha{\^i}ne op{\'e}ratoire, are centred on the human senses---and thus on metalworking as a craft. This is a pragmatic approach that appreciates scientific measurements of metal objects as essential empirical evidence whilst recognising that a considerable share of these archaeometric data are inapt or too detailed for an understanding of skill. This empirical approach towards skill is relevant to our knowledge of the role of crafts and materials in the past. After all, skill is a fundamental asset for the production of material culture, and a distinct human-material relationship characterised by an intimate form of material engagement.},

Inferences about this period are challenging to make because demographic shifts in the past 5,000 years have obscured the structures of more ancient populations               3,5               . Here we present genome-wide ancient DNA data for six individuals from eastern and south-central Africa spanning the past approximately~18,000 years (doubling the time depth of sub-Saharan African ancient DNA), increase the data quality for 15 previously published ancient individuals and analyse these alongside data from 13 other published ancient individuals. The ancestry of the individuals in our study area can be modelled as a geographically structured mixture of three highly divergent source populations, probably reflecting Pleistocene interactions around 80\textendash 20 thousand years ago, including deeply diverged eastern and southern African lineages, plus a previously unappreciated ubiquitous distribution of ancestry that occurs in highest proportion today in~central~African rainforest hunter-gatherers. Once established, this structure remained highly stable, with limited long-range gene flow. These results provide a new line of genetic evidence in support of hypotheses that have emerged from archaeological analyses but remain contested, suggesting increasing regionalization at the end of the Pleistocene epoch.},

  abstract = {The excavation of a series of graveyards during the '50 and '70 in the Upemba depression (Katanga, DRC) led to the establishment of a cultural sequence spanning the 7th to the 20th century AD. This sequence consists in a succession of archaeological cultures displaying elements of rupture and continuity, particularly visible in the shape and decoration of pottery. To answer questions pertaining to population dynamics in central Katanga, we decided to check whether or not these variations where reflected in pottery roughing-out technologies. Because they are related to a strong interaction between master and apprentice and are associated to an essential step of pottery apprenticeship, pottery roughing-out methods are indeed considered to be more stable -- i.e. related to deeply rooted forms of identity - than form or decoration. In this paper, we present the analysis and reconstruction of Kabambian pottery roughing-out methods - a first for central Africa. Our conclusion indicates, that Kabambian pottery (dated between the 13th and the 18th century AD) was made by cylindrical coiling with slab bottom.},

  abstract = {During the warmer Holocene Period, two major climatic crises affected the Central African rainforests. The first crisis, around 4000 cal yr BP, caused the contraction of the forest in favor of savanna expansion at its northern and southern periphery. The second crisis, around 2500 cal yr BP, resulted in major perturbation at the forest core, leading to forest disturbance and fragmentation with a rapid expansion of pioneer-type vegetation, and a marked erosional phase. The major driver of these two climatic crises appears to be rapid sea-surface temperature variations in the equatorial eastern Atlantic, which modified the regional atmospheric circulation. The change between ca. 2500 to 2000 cal yr BP led to a large increase in thunderstorm activity, which explains the phase of forest fragmentation. Ultimately, climatic data obtained recently show that the present-day major rise in thunderstorms and lightning activity in Central Africa could result from some kind of solar influence, and hence the phase of forest fragmentation between ca. 2500 to 2000 cal yr BP may provide a model for the present-day global warming-related environmental changes in this region.},

  abstract = {Human settlement of the Caribbean represents the only example in the Americas of peoples colonizing islands that were not visible from surrounding mainland areas or other islands. Unfortunately, many interpretive models have relied on radiocarbon determinations that do not meet standard criteria for reporting because they lack critical information or sufficient provenience, often leading to specious interpretations. We have collated 2484 radiocarbon determinations, assigned them to classes based on chronometric hygiene criteria, and constructed Bayesian colonization models of the acceptable determinations to examine patterns of initial settlement. Colonization estimates for 26 islands indicate that (i) the region was settled in two major population dispersals that likely originated from South America; (ii) colonists reached islands in the northern Antilles before the southern islands; and (iii) the results support the southward route hypothesis and refute the ``stepping-stone model.''},

This review provides a spatiotemporal framework of human settlement in the forest biome. Beyond the well-known initial spread of Iron Age populations through central African forests from 2500 cal BP, it depicts the geographical patterns and links with the cultural evolution of the successive phases of human expansion from 5000 to 3000 cal BP and then from 3000 to 1600 cal BP, of the hinterland depopulation from 1350 to 860 cal BP, and of recolonization up to 500 cal BP.

Within this framework, a first approach to the chronological variability of pottery through the analysis of 58 ceramic thin sections is carried out. The samples correspond to vessels made by complex hunter-gatherer groups between 625 {\textpm} 46 and 1.380 {\textpm} 100 14C years BP. The pottery was recovered from three archaeological sites: Arroyo Arenal 1, Arroyo Largo I, and La Palmera II (Entre Rios Province, northeastern Argentina), which are linked to an archaeological unit locally called Goya-Malabrigo. The results show, among other chronological variations, an increasing trend in the use of grog temper over time. These data allow the expansion of knowledge about the ceramic technology of human groups who occupied the area of the Paran{\'a} River during the Late Holocene.},

In this paper, we provide a critical review of the extant linguistic and molecular anthropological data on Africa and discuss the insights they provide concerning the expansion itself as well as the demographic processes involved in it. Contrary to some assumptions by historians and cultural anthropologists, the genetic data speak in favor of an actual movement of peoples during the expansion of the Bantu languages over Africa, rather than a spread through language and culture shift. Furthermore, the molecular data indicate that sociocultural practices such as patrilocalityand possiblyeven polygynyplayed a role in shaping the genetic diversity of Bantu-speaking peoples. These sociocultural practices might explain why, in Africa, there is a correlation between Y-chromosomal (i.e., paternal) lineages and linguistic affiliation, but not betweenmtDNA (maternal) lineages and language.},

Our results support a multi-phase model in which admixture between northeastern African-related peoples and eastern African foragers formed multiple pastoralist groups, including a genetically homogeneous PN cluster. Additional admixture with northeastern and western African-related groups occurred by the Iron Age. These findings support several movements of food producers, while rejecting models of minimal admixture with foragers and of genetic differentiation between makers of distinct PN artifacts.},

This zooarchaeological study addresses whether the presence of spicules of freshwater sponges in this pottery was a conscious choice on behalf of ancient potters. Based on faunal elements detected in the collection of the Vereda III site and information obtained from ethnographic records and archaeological research on the presence of cauixi in pottery, we discuss whetherits presence in the material results from the inclusion of processed freshwater sponges in the clay or if it derives from the exploitation of sedimentary deposits with spicules. As one of the outcomes, this articlepoints to a necessary revision of the archaeological pottery material of the Aratu-Sapuca{\'i} tradition in Minas Gerais where the identification of cauixi and its origin should both be considered.},

While for the past decades' pottery finds were used to establish sequences of stylistically interrelated pottery groups and to derive regional chrono-historical frameworks, the way these communities of practice transmitted their approaches and expertise throughout generations is still unknown. The first study focusing on petrographic characterizations of ceramics from the north-western parts of the Congo Basin showed distinct phases of similar clay procurement and processing. Of special interest is the site of Pikunda (PIK). In the late 1980s, multiple archaeological features were excavated and ethnographic observations on potters' production showed a particular {$<$}em{$>$}cha{\^i}ne op{\'e}ratoire{$<$}/em{$>$}, comprised of coiling, internal scraping, and external beating. Clay procurement and preparation were not recorded though.},

The petrographic analysis confirmed the high frequency of freshwater sponge spicules (cauixi) as a non-plastic, with novel data on the distribution of spicules that allow us to infer the process of ceramic paste preparation and vessel manufacture. The same proportion between clay matrix and sponge spicules was maintained throughout all Bacabal layers, independent of individual variations for each element. This allows us to infer the existence of a pottery recipe maintained throughout the Bacabal occupation of the site. The same type of sponge spicule described in the ceramic paste was identified in clayey sediments surveyed in the region, although at a lower frequency. Thus, the manufacture of Bacabal ceramics could have involved a combination of: selection of spicule-rich clays; and intentionally added sponge spicules. Sponge spicules in the Bacabal pottery represent an exceptional case for research into the development of ceramic technologies supported by the use of these non-plastics, which became popular during the Upper Holocene in the lowlands of South America.},
